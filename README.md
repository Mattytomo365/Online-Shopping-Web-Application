# Online Shopping Web Application
## Overview
This is an online shopping web application and stock management system that I built in Visual Studio, using ASP.NET MVC and C#. It is connected to a database developed in Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio, containing tables that store data regarding user/administrative accounts, orders, and products. It also houses the various SQL statements for retrieving, adding, updating tables etc. These SQL statements are then called from the program through the use of repos.

Users are provided with a seamless experience, inluding browsing products, managing a shopping cart, and placing orders. Authenticating users allows for returning users to view previous orders. 

This application allows for administrative roles, upon authentication, administrators can manage stock, and add/remove products from the database.
